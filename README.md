# Diabetes Prediction Using Machine Learning

## Project Overview
This project predicts whether a person has diabetes or not using the **Pima Indians Diabetes dataset**. A machine learning model is trained to analyze various health parameters and provide predictions.

## Features
- Accepts inputs such as pregnancies, glucose level, blood pressure, skin thickness, insulin, BMI, diabetes pedigree function, and age.
- Predicts if the person is diabetic or not.
- Implemented in Python using **scikit-learn**.
- Includes data preprocessing with **standard scaling** for accurate predictions.

## Dataset
- The project uses the **Pima Indians Diabetes dataset**.
- The dataset is included in the repository as `dataset.csv`.

## How to Use
1. Open the notebook `Diabetes_Prediction.ipynb` in **Google Colab** or **Jupyter Notebook**.
2. Ensure all required libraries are installed: `numpy`, `pandas`, `scikit-learn`.
3. Run all the cells to train the model and make predictions.
4. You can input new data to test predictions. Example:
